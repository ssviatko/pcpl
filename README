pc.pl

A fun, simple, and useful Perl script to prove to potential employers that I know Perl.

   Requires perl (any version that supports sockets), netcat.

This is a simple chat system reminiscent of Diversi-Dial on an Apple //.
To use this program: Under Linux, type chmod +x pc.pl and ./pc.pl in one window,
Type "nc localhost 9734" (or whatever port pc.pl is listening on) in another window.
Make as many connections to the machine running pc.pl as desired, up to $MAX_PEERS.
Type /help for a list of commands once you are connected with netcat.
Use of the /exec command is strongly cautioned if pc.pl is running in a root session!
